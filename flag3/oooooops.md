# OMG, Soory!

I lost my flag.txt :(

```
$ sha256sum flag.txt
0cb5ae6d33f24a713d63369fc452f099104c4614a678934fe3c33f3bead58383  flag.txt

$ rm -rf flag.txt
```

# Do you want to know more?

It was a string of characters that looked like this.

```
flag3 is : "X"
```

I hate `\n`, long letters and capital letters.
I remember it was 3~6 letters.
